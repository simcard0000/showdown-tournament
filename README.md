# showdown-tournament
🕹️Site for Pokémon Showdown! - Future Nostalgia v1.0 W24 Tournament

### About
Coming soon...

### Development
To compile JS properly: `browserify page-script.js --standalone myFunctions > bundle.js`.

### Credits
The tournament bracket website is hosted with Netlify, and deployed on a subdomain of my personal website [simranthind.me](https://simranthind.me/). This project uses [brackets-manager.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-manager.js), `brackets-memory-db`, and [brackets-viewer.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js) from [Corentin Girard](https://github.com/Drarig29); plus [Browserify](https://browserify.org/). All aforementioned packages/libraries are installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), with the exception of the viewer which makes use of the [jsDeliver CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

The website is typeset with [Kode Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kode+Mono). The logo/title image for the tournament, as well as the y2k-inspired graphics, were created and arranged through [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Fonts used within Canva include
